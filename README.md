# Brain Like Computation and Intelligence - Group 21

## Project Overview

This repository contains code and resources used to run the project of the BLCI course. The project explores task-driven and/or data driven models as well as a mix of the two to model and predict firing rates of IT neurons according to image datasets. In the different weeks(6,7,8), we utilize linear models, regularized ridge regression, PCA-Based dimensionality reduction, pre-trained and randomly initialized neural networks, as well as our own architectures and compare how well they perform.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains several folders:

- `week6.ipynb` contains the notebook for the week 6 assignment, where we run the task driven models as well as the initial linear and ridge regression models. There, it also refers to `my_neural_prediction_results` and `my_neural_prediction_results_randomly_init`

- `my_neural_prediction_results/` and `my_neural_prediction_results_randomly_init/`: These contain the pickle files for the randomly initialized model, as well as the results of the predictions
